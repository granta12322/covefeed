# Data Model Requirements
Needs to let users record the drink they had, how they rate it, the coffee bean used and time information about that coffee bean.

Users should be able to view how other users have rated the same bean and browse recipes for it.



# Entities
## Coffee Bean
### Attributes 
- Country
- Altitude
- *Farm/Farm name* ? (optional, adds complexity)
- Harvest date
- Roast date
- Roast level


### Considerations
- Need a way to search for coffee beans so duplicates aren't constantly being added. Presumably done by country, harvest date, name, name of farm?


## Drink
### Attributes
- Date
- Bean
- Style (cappucino e.t.c.)
- Recipe 
- Tasting notes
- Extraction level
- Overall quality
- Additional notes

## Tasting notes
### Attributes
- Look at a tasting notes wheel to produce a categorisation hierarchy. Do not allow people to add their own.

## Brewing device
### Attributes
- Just a field with limited options.

## Grind size
### Attributes
- Field with limited options (*use pictures to illustrate*):
    1. Super fine
    2. Fine
    3. Medium Fine
    4. Medium
    5. Medium Coarse
    6. Coarse
    7. Super Coarse

## Recipe
### Attributes
- Brewing device
- Coffee mass
- Total Water mass
- Grind Size
- Milk mass 
- Bloom/pre-infusion time + volume
- Total Brew time + volume
- Notes (free text field.)

### Considerations
Could this be better off as a list of steps?
